# chessTs
Just a standard chess game.

The game is not full-fledged yet!

The RWD is not applied here on purpose - the main goal of this app was to practise TypeScript.

Things to finish: 1) stalemate, 2) informing players about the checkmate, 3) The code needs to be refactored to be more maintainable and scalable - it is a "raw" version, which was created only in 3 consecutive days.
